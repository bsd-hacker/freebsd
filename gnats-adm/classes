#		    Possible classes for a PR.
#
# Any line which begins with a `#' is considered a comment, and GNATS
# will ignore it. 
#
# Each entry has the format:
#
# 	class[:type[:description]]
#
# that is, either of the following is okay:
#
#	sw-bug
#	sw-bug:class
#	sw-bug:class:Software bug
#	sw-bug::Software bug
#
# * `class' is the name of the class; it can contain alphanumerics,
#   "-", "_", and ".", but no other characters.
#
# * `type' is the optional name of the class type; it can contain
#   alphanumerics, "-", "_", and ".", but no other characters. The
#   only defined class type is "class", but it's not actually used 
#   for anything.
#
#   `description' is an optional one-line description of what this
#   class means.  Any character is okay in the description; a newline
#   ends it, however.  GNATS does not currently use the description,
#   other than to include it in the --list-classes command, but
#   certain external tools (such as TkGnats) look for it, so it's
#   a good idea include one for every class.
#
# The first listed class is the default class for an incoming Problem
# Report.
