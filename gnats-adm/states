#		    Possible states for a PR.
#
# Any line which begins with a `#' is considered a comment, and GNATS
# will ignore it. 
#
# Each entry has the format:
#
# 	state[:type[:description]]
#
# that is, any of the following are okay:
#
#	suspended
#	suspended:closed
#	suspended:closed:No solution yet, work on it also suspended for the time being.
#	suspended::No solution yet, work on it also suspended for the time being.
#
# * `state' is the name of the state; it can contain alphanumerics,
#   "-", "_", and ".", but no other characters.
#
# * `type' is the optional name of the state type; it can contain
#   alphanumerics, "-", "_", and ".", but no other characters. The
#   only defined state types are "open" and "closed". The "open" state
#   isn't currently used for anything. Changing the state of a PR to
#   any state of type "closed" will set the Closed-Date field with a
#   time stamp. Changing the state of a PR from one "closed" state to
#   another will leave the Closed-Date field as it was. Changing the
#   state of a PR from any state of type "closed" to a non-closed
#   state will clear the Closed-Date field.  The "--skip-closed"
#   option of query-pr and nquery-pr looks at the state types for the
#   "closed" type, not for a state name of "closed".
#
#   `description' is an optional one-line description of what this
#   state means.  Any character is okay in the description; a newline
#   ends it, however.  GNATS does not currently use the description,
#   other than to include it in the --list-states command, but certain
#   external tools (such as TkGnats) look for it, so it's a good
#   idea include one for every state.
#
# The first listed state is the default state for an incoming Problem
# Report.  The last listed state is considered one of the final
# ("closed") states for a Problem Report and will be forced to have a
# type of "closed". Once a PR is in this state, its life-cycle is
# usually over unless someone re-opens it.

# It is recommended that the first state always be "open", as some
# external tools may look for this to determine whether or not a PR
# has been acted on.  Change at your own risk.

open::Default state for a new problem report.

# The middle states are what you think is useful; customize them as
# you wish.  You can add or delete states here; it is not required
# that there be three of them. Depending on your definition of the
# suspended state, you may want to set its type to be "closed".

analyzed::The problem is understood and a solution is being sought.
suspended::Valid, but suspended due to lack of information or resources.
feedback::Awaiting further information from originator or community.
patched::Patch committed, awaiting MFC and / or further testing.
repocopy::Awaiting a repocopy before further action can be taken.

# Where old PRs go to die.  Like "open", there may be external tools
# which look for this state to know if a PR is still active.  Change
# at your own risk. The last state will be forced to be a "closed" type
# even if you specify something else.

closed:closed:Issue has been resolved or abandoned.
