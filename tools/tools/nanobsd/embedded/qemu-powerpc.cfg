# This file is heavily derived from both Sam Leffler's Avilia config,
# as well as the BSDRP project's config file.  Neither of these have
# an explicit copyright/license statement, but are implicitly BSDL. This
# example has been taken from the FreeNAS project and simplified to meet
# the needs of the example.
