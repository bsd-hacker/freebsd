Create meta files when not doing DIRDEPS_BUILD.
When the
.Xr filemon 4
module is loaded, dependencies will be tracked for all commands.
If any command, its dependencies, or files it generates are missing then
the target will be considered out-of-date and rebuilt.
The meta files can also be useful for debugging.
.Pp
The build will hide commands ran unless
.Va NO_SILENT
is defined.
