<p>Anyone with a valid commit bit in at least one of FreeBSD's repositories (src, doc, ports) can log in with their FreeBSD user name.  However, only active committers, i.e. those who have made at least one commit in the twelve months preceding the election, are allowed to run or vote in the election.  Inactive committers can only observe.</p>

  [% ELSE %]
<p>You are not registered as an active committer, and are therefore not qualified to run or vote in the election.  If you believe this is incorrect, please contact the election administrator.</p>
