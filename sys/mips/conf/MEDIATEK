# MEDIATEK -- Kernel configuration file for FreeBSD/MIPS Mediatek/Ralink SoCs
#
# This includes all the configurable parts of the kernel. Please read through
# the sections below and customize the options to fit your board if needed.
#
# $FreeBSD$
#

#NO_UNIVERSE

# Don't build any modules by default
makeoptions 	MODULES_OVERRIDE=""

#
# Default rootfs device configuration, should be changed to suit target board
#
options 	ROOTDEVNAME=\"ufs:md0.uzip\"

#
# Optional drivers section
#
# What follows is optional support drivers for the Mediatek SoCs.
# The kernel can be compiled without them if size is a concern.
# All optional drivers are built by default.
#

# Support geom_uzip(4) compressed disk images
device 		geom_uzip
options 	GEOM_UZIP

# Support md(4) and md-based rootfs
device 		md
options 	MD_ROOT

# SPI and SPI flash support
device 		spibus
device 		mx25l

# GPIO and gpioled support
device 		gpio
device 		gpioled

# PCI support
device 		pci

#
# USB (ehci, ohci, xhci, otg) support. Unneeded drivers can be commented in
# order to lower kernel size. See below for driver SoC support.
#
# For all SoCs that require USB support
device 		usb
# For RT3050, RT3052 and RT3350 SoCs
device 		dwcotg
# For RT3352, RT3662, RT3883, RT5350, MT7620, MT7628 and MT7688
device 		ohci
device 		ehci
# For MT7621, or cases where the target board has a XHCI controller on PCI
# (for example Asus RT-N65U)
device 		xhci

# USB umass(4) storage and da(4) support
device 		umass
device 		da

# ahci(4) and ada(4) support, depends on PCI
device 		ahci
device 		ada

# CAM support, required if either umass(4) or ahci(4) is enabled above
device 		pass
device 		scbus

# Ethernet, BPS and bridge support
device 		rt
device 		bpf
device 		if_bridge

# Extres
device 		ext_resources
