   The Chinese Calendar

   Chinese New Year Celebrations

   Chinese New Year parades have their origins in the California Gold Rush,
   when immigrants sought to share their culture. Today, New Year's parades
   take place around the globe.

   Chinese New Year is the main holiday of the year for more than one quarter
   of the world's population. Although the People's Republic of China uses
   the Gregorian calendar for civil purposes, a special Chinese calendar is
   used for determining festivals. Various Chinese communities around the
   world also use this calendar.

   The beginnings of the Chinese calendar can be traced back to the 14th
   century B.C.E. Legend has it that the Emperor Huangdi invented the
   calendar in 2637 B.C.E.

   The Chinese calendar is based on exact astronomical observations of the
   longitude of the sun and the phases of the moon. This means that
   principles of modern science have had an impact on the Chinese calendar.

 What Does the Chinese Year Look Like?

   The Chinese calendar - like the Hebrew - is a combined solar/lunar
   calendar in that it strives to have its years coincide with the tropical
   year and its months coincide with the synodic months. It is not surprising
   that a few similarities exist between the Chinese and the Hebrew calendar:

     * An ordinary year has 12 months, a leap year has 13 months.
     * An ordinary year has 353, 354, or 355 days, a leap year has 383, 384,
       or 385 days.

|  When determining what a Chinese year looks like, one must make a number of
|  astronomical calculations:
|
|  First, determine the dates for the new moons. Here, a new moon is the
|  completely "black" moon (that is, when the moon is in conjunction with the
|  sun), not the first visible crescent used in the Islamic and Hebrew
|  calendars. The date of a new moon is the first day of a new month.
|
|  Second, determine the dates when the sun's longitude is a multiple of 30
|  degrees. (The sun's longitude is 0 at Vernal Equinox, 90 at Summer
|  Solstice, 180 at Autumnal Equinox, and 270 at Winter Solstice.) These
|  dates are called the Principal Terms and are used to determine the number
|  of each month:

     * Principal Term 1 occurs when the sun's longitude is 330 degrees.
     * Principal Term 2 occurs when the sun's longitude is 0 degrees.
     * Principal Term 3 occurs when the sun's longitude is 30 degrees. (etc.)
     * Principal Term 11 occurs when the sun's longitude is 270 degrees.
     * Principal Term 12 occurs when the sun's longitude is 300 degrees.

   Each month carries the number of the Principal Term that occurs in that
   month.

   In rare cases, a month may contain two Principal Terms; in this case the
   months numbers may have to be shifted. Principal Term 11 (Winter Solstice)
   must always fall in the 11th month.

|  All the astronomical calculations are carried out for the meridian 120
|  degrees east of Greenwich. This roughly corresponds to the east coast of
|  China.

   Some variations in these rules are seen in various Chinese communities.

 What Years Are Leap Years?

   Leap years have 13 months. To determine if a year is a leap year,
   calculate the number of new moons between the 11th month in one year
   (i.e., the month containing the Winter Solstice) and the 11th month in the
   following year. If there are 13 new moons from the start of the 11th month
   in the first year to the start of the 11th month in the second year, a
   leap month must be inserted.

   In leap years, at least one month does not contain a Principal Term. The
   first such month is the leap month. It carries the same number as the
   previous month, with the additional note that it is the leap month.

 How Does One Count Years?

   Unlike most other calendars, the Chinese calendar does not count years in
   an infinite sequence. Instead years have names that are repeated every 60
   years.

   (Historically, years used to be counted since the accession of an emperor,
   but this was abolished after the 1911 revolution.)

   Within each 60-year cycle, each year is assigned name consisting of two
   components:

   The first component is a Celestial Stemm. These words have no English
   equivalent:

   1 jia  6  ji
   2 yi   7  geng
   3 bing 8  xin
   4 ding 9  ren
   5 wu   10 gui

   The second component is a Terrestrial Branch. The names of the
   corresponding animals in the zodiac cycle of 12 animals are given in
   parentheses.

   1 zi (rat)           7  wu (horse)
   2 chou (ox)          8  wei (sheep)
   3 yin (tiger)        9  shen (monkey)
   4 mao (hare, rabbit) 10 you (rooster)
   5 chen (dragon)      11 xu (dog)
   6 si (snake)         12 hai (pig)

   Each of the two components is used sequentially. Thus, the 1st year of the
   60-year cycle becomes jia-zi, the 2nd year is yi-chou, the 3rd year is
   bing-yin, etc. When we reach the end of a component, we start from the
   beginning: The 10th year is gui-you, the 11th year is jia-xu (restarting
   the Celestial Stem), the 12th year is yi-hai, and the 13th year is bing-zi
   (restarting the Terrestrial Branch). Finally, the 60th year becomes
   gui-hai.

   This way of naming years within a 60-year cycle goes back approximately
   2000 years. A similar naming of days and months has fallen into disuse,
   but the date name is still listed in calendars.

   It is customary to number the 60-year cycles since 2637 B.C.E., when the
   calendar was supposedly invented. In that year the first 60-year cycle
   started.

 What Is the Current Year in the Chinese Calendar?

|  The current 60-year cycle started on 2 Feb 1984. That date bears the name
|  bing-yin in the 60-day cycle, and the first month of that first year bears
|  the name gui-chou in the 60-month cycle.

   This means that the year wu-yin, the 15th year in the 78th cycle, started
   on 28 Jan 1998. The 20th year in the 78th cycle, started on 1 Feb 2003.

   The following are dates for Chinese/Lunar New Year's day:

 What about the year 2033?

   In the early 1990s, Chinese astronomers discovered that there was an error
   in the Chinese calendar for 2033. The traditional calendar claimed that
   the leap month would follow the 7th month, while in fact it comes after
   the 11th month. It is very unusual that the 11th month has a leap month,
   in fact it hasn't happened since the calendar reform in 1645 (before 1645,
   all months had the same probability for having a leap month). But many
   Chinese astronomers still claim that there will never be a leap month
   after the 12th and 1st month. In addition, there will be a leap month
   after the 1st month in 2262 (in fact, it should have happened in 1651, but
   they got the calculations wrong!) and there will be a leap month after the
   12th month in 3358. Since the Chinese calendar is an astronomical
   calendar, predictions require delicate astronomical calculations, so my
   computations for 3358 should probably be taken with a grain of salt.

 When did the calendar really start?

   If the Chinese calendar started in 2637 B.C.E., why is the current year 60
   years too late? (e.g., in 1999, the current year was 4697? and not 4637)?

   The Chinese calendar does not use a continuous year count! They used a 60
   year cycle and a system of regional years (starting with each emperor).
   Before the 1911 revolution, Sun Yat-sen wanted to establish a republican
   alternative to the imperial reign cycles. According to Chinese tradition,
   the first year of the Yellow Emperor was 2698 B.C.E., so he introduced a
   counting system based on this. Under this system, 2000 is year 4698. An
   alternative system is to start with the first historical record of the
   60-day cycle from March 8, 2637 B.C.E. Based on this system, 2000 is year
   4637.

                               shang oracle bones

   Two oracle bones from the Shang Dynasty in China (c. 1800 - 1200 BCE)

   Evidence from the Shang oracle bone inscriptions shows that at least by
   the 14th century BC the Shang Chinese had established the solar year at
   365 1/4 days and lunation at 29 1/2 days. In the calendar that the Shang
   used, the seasons of the year and the phases of the Moon were all
   supposedly accounted for.

 What was the Early Chinese calendar?

   In China, the calendar was a sacred document, sponsored and promulgated by
   the reigning monarch. For more than two millennia, a Bureau of Astronomy
   made astronomical observations, calculated astronomical events such as
   eclipses, prepared astrological predictions, and maintained the calendar.
   After all, a successful calendar not only served practical needs, but also
   confirmed the consonance between Heaven and the imperial court.

   Analysis of surviving astronomical records inscribed on oracle bones
   reveals a Chinese lunisolar calendar, with intercalation of lunar months,
   dating back to the Shang dynasty of the fourteenth century B.C.E. Various
   intercalation schemes were developed for the early calendars, including
   the nineteen-year and 76-year lunar phase cycles that came to be known in
   the West as the Metonic cycle and Callipic cycle.

   From the earliest records, the beginning of the year occurred at a New
   Moon near the winter solstice. The choice of month for beginning the civil
   year varied with time and place, however. In the late second century
   B.C.E., a calendar reform established the practice, which continues today,
   of requiring the winter solstice to occur in month 11. This reform also
   introduced the intercalation system in which dates of New Moons are
   compared with the 24 solar terms. However, calculations were based on the
   mean motions resulting from the cyclic relationships. Inequalities in the
   Moon's motions were incorporated as early as the seventh century C.E., but
   the Sun's mean longitude was used for calculating the solar terms until
   1644.

   Years were counted from a succession of eras established by reigning
   emperors. Although the accession of an emperor would mark a new era, an
   emperor might also declare a new era at various times within his reign.
   The introduction of a new era was an attempt to reestablish a broken
   connection between Heaven and Earth, as personified by the emperor. The
   break might be revealed by the death of an emperor, the occurrence of a
   natural disaster, or the failure of astronomers to predict a celestial
   event such as an eclipse. In the latter case, a new era might mark the
   introduction of new astronomical or calendrical models.

   Sexagenary cycles were used to count years, months, days, and fractions of
   a day using the set of Celestial Stems and Terrestrial Branches. Use of
   the sixty-day cycle is seen in the earliest astronomical records. By
   contrast the sixty-year cycle was introduced in the first century C.E. or
   possibly a century earlier. Although the day count has fallen into disuse
   in everyday life, it is still tabulated in calendars. The initial year
   (jia-zi) of the current year cycle began on 1984 February 2, which is the
   third day (bing-yin) of the day cycle.

 Details of early calendars

   One of the two methods that they used to make this calendar was to add an
   extra month of 29 or 30 days, which they termed the 13th month, to the end
   of a regular 12-month year. There is also evidence that suggests that the
   Chinese developed the Metonic cycle (see above Complex cycles) - i.e., 19
   years with a total of 235 months-a century ahead of Meton's first
   calculation (no later than the Spring and Autumn period, 770-476 BC).
   During this cycle of 19 years there were seven intercalations of months.
   The other method, which was abandoned soon after the Shang started to
   adopt it, was to insert an extra month between any two months of a regular
   year. Possibly, a lack of astronomical and arithmetical knowledge allowed
   them to do this.

   By the 3rd century BC, the first method of intercalation was gradually
   falling into disfavour, while the establishment of the meteorological
   cycle, the erh-shih-ssu chieh-ch'i (Pinyin ershisi jieqi), during this
   period officially revised the second method. This meteorological cycle
   contained 24 points, each beginning one of the periods named consecutively
   the Spring Begins, the Rain Water, the Excited Insects, the Vernal
   Equinox, the Clear and Bright, the Grain Rains, the Summer Begins, the
   Grain Fills, the Grain in Ear, the Summer Solstice, the Slight Heat, the
   Great Heat, the Autumn Begins, the Limit of Heat, the White Dew, the
   Autumn Equinox, the Cold Dew, the Hoar Frost Descends, the Winter Begins,
   the Little Snow, the Heavy Snow, the Winter Solstice, the Little Cold, and
   the Severe Cold. The establishment of this cycle required a fair amount of
   astronomical understanding of the Earth as a celestial body, and without
   elaborate equipment it is impossible to collect the necessary information.
   Modern scholars acknowledge the superiority of pre-Sung Chinese astronomy
   (at least until about the 13th century AD) over that of other,
   contemporary nations.

   The 24 points within the meteorological cycle coincide with points 15-o
   apart on the ecliptic (the plane of the Earth's yearly journey around the
   Sun or, if it is thought that the Sun turns around the Earth, the apparent
   journey of the Sun against the stars). It takes about 15.2 days for the
   Sun to travel from one of these points to another (because the ecliptic is
   a complete circle of 360-o), and the Sun needs 365  1/4 days to finish its
   journey in this cycle. Supposedly, each of the 12 months of the year
   contains two points, but, because a lunar month has only 29  1/2 days and
   the two points share about 30.4 days, there is always the chance that a
   lunar month will fail to contain both points, though the distance between
   any two given points is only 15-o. If such an occasion occurs, the
   intercalation of an extra month takes place. For instance, one may find a
   year with two "Julys" or with two "Augusts" in the Chinese calendar. In
   fact, the exact length of the month in the Chinese calendar is either 30
   days or 29 days-a phenomenon which reflects its lunar origin. Also, the
   meteorological cycle means essentially a solar year. The Chinese thus
   consider their calendar as yin-yang li, or a "lunar-solar calendar."

 When were foreign calendars introduced?

   Although the yin-yang li has been continuously employed by the Chinese,
   foreign calendars were introduced to the Chinese, the Hindu calendar, for
   instance, during the T'ang (Tang) dynasty (618-907), and were once used
   concurrently with the native calendar. This situation also held true for
   the Muslim calendar, which was introduced during the Yuean dynasty
   (1206-1368). The Gregorian calendar was taken to China by Jesuit
   missionaries in 1582, the very year that it was first used by Europeans.
   Not until 1912, after the general public adopted the Gregorian calendar,
   did the yin-yang li lose its primary importance.

   Western (pre-Copernican) astronomical theories were introduced to China by
   Jesuit missionaries in the seventeenth century. Gradually, more modern
   Western concepts became known. Following the revolution of 1911, the
   traditional practice of counting years from the accession of an emperor
   was abolished.
