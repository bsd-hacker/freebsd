.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm "kyua report"
.Nd Generates reports with the results of a test suite run
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl -output Ar path
.Op Fl -results-file Ar file
.Op Fl -results-filter Ar types
.Op Fl -verbose
.Op Ar test_filter1 .. test_filterN
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command parses a results file and generates a user-friendly, plaintext
report for user consumption on the terminal.
By default, these reports only display a summary of the execution of the full
test suite to highlight where problems may lie.
.Pp
The output of
.Nm
can be customized to display full details on all executed test cases.
Additionally, the optional arguments to
.Nm
are used to select which test programs or test cases to display.
These are filters and are described below in
.Sx Test filters .
.Pp
Reports generated by
.Nm
are
.Em not intended to be machine-parseable .
.Pp
The following subcommand options are recognized:
.Bl -tag -width XX
.It Fl -output Ar path
Specifies the path to which the report should be written to.
The special values
.Pa /dev/stdout
and
.Pa /dev/stderr
can be used to specify the standard output and the standard error,
respectively.

Specifies the results file to operate on.
Defaults to
.Sq LATEST ,
which causes
.Nm
to automatically load the latest results file from the current test suite.
.Pp
The following values are accepted:
.Bl -tag -width XX
.It Sq LATEST
Requests the load of the latest results file available for the test suite rooted
at the current directory.
.It Directory
Requests the load of the latest results file available for the test suite rooted
at the given directory.
.It Test suite name
Requests the load of the latest results file available for the given test suite.
.It Results identifier
Requests the load of a specific results file.
.It Explicit file name (aka everything else)
Load the specified results file.
.El
.Pp
See
.Sx Results files
for more details.
.It Fl -results-filter Ar types
Comma-separated list of the test result types to include in the report.
The ordering of the values is respected so that you can determine how you
want the list of tests to be shown.
.Pp
The valid values are:
.Sq broken ,
.Sq failed ,
.Sq passed ,
.Sq skipped
and
.Sq xfail .
If the parameter supplied to the option is empty, filtering is suppressed
and all result types are shown in the report.
.Pp
The default value for this flag includes all the test results except the
passed tests.
Showing the passed tests by default clutters the report with too much
information, so only abnormal conditions are included.
.It Fl -verbose
Prints a detailed report of the execution.
In addition to all the information printed by default, verbose reports
include the runtime context of the test suite run, the metadata of each
test case, and the verbatim output of the test cases.

Results files contain, as their name implies, the results of the execution of a
test suite.
Each test suite executed by
.Xr kyua-test 1
generates a new results file, and such results files can be loaded later on by
inspection commands such as
.Xr kyua-report 1
to analyze their contents.
.Pp
Results files support identifier-based lookups and also path name lookups.
The differences between the two are described below.
.Pp
The default naming scheme for the results files provides simple support for
identifier-based lookups and historical recording of test suite runs.
Each results file is given an identifier derived from the test suite that
generated it and the time the test suite was run.
Kyua can later look up results files by these fields.
.Pp
The identifier follows this pattern:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
\*(Lttest_suite\*(Gt.\*(LtYYYYMMDD\*(Gt-\*(LtHHMMSS\*(Gt-\*(Ltuuuuuu\*(Gt
.Ed
.Pp
where
.Sq test_suite
is the path to the root of the test suite that was run with all slashes replaced
by underscores and
.Sq YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-uuuuuu
is a timestamp with microsecond resolution.
.Pp
When using the default naming scheme, results files are stored in the
.Pa ~/.kyua/store/
subdirectory and each file holds a name of the form:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
~/.kyua/store/results.\*(Ltidentifier\*(Gt.db
.Ed
.Pp
Results files are simple SQLite databases with the schema described in the
.Pa /usr/share/kyua/store/schema_v?.sql
files.
For details on the schema, please refer to the heavily commented SQL file.

A
.Em test filter
is a string that is used to match test cases or test programs in a test suite.
Filters have the following form:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
test_program_name[:test_case_name]
.Ed
.Pp
Where
.Sq test_program_name
is the name of a test program or a subdirectory in the test suite, and
.Sq test_case_name
is the name of a test case.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
command returns 0 if no filters were specified or if all filters match one
or more test cases.
If any filter fails to match any test case, the command returns 1.
.Pp
Additional exit codes may be returned as described in
.Xr kyua 1 .
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Ss Workflow with results files
If one runs the following command twice in a row:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
kyua test -k /usr/tests/Kyuafile
.Ed
.Pp
the two executions will generate two different files with names like:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
~/.kyua/store/results.usr_tests.20140731-150500-196784.db
~/.kyua/store/results.usr_tests.20140731-151730-997451.db
.Ed
.Pp
Taking advantage of the default naming scheme, the following commands would all
generate a report for the results of the
.Em latest
execution of the test suite:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd /usr/tests && kyua report
cd /usr/tests && kyua report --results-file=LATEST
kyua report --results-file=/usr/tests
kyua report --results-file=usr_tests
kyua report --results-file=usr_tests.20140731-151730-997451
.Ed
.Pp
But it is also possible to explicitly load data for older runs or from
explicitly-named files:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
kyua report \\
    --results-file=usr_tests.20140731-150500-196784
kyua report \\
    --results-file=~/.kyua/store/results.usr_tests.20140731-150500-196784.db
