.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm "kyua test"
.Nd Runs tests
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl -build-root Ar path
.Op Fl -kyuafile Ar file
.Op Fl -results-file Ar file
.Op Ar test_filter1 .. test_filterN
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command loads a test suite definition from a
.Xr kyuafile 5 ,
runs the tests defined in it, and records the results into a new results
file.
By default, all tests in the test suite are executed but the optional
arguments to
.Nm
can be used to select which test programs or test cases to run.
These are filters and are described below in
.Sx Test filters .
.Pp
Every test executed by
.Nm
is run under a controlled environment as described in
.Sx Test isolation .
.Pp
The following subcommand options are recognized:
.Bl -tag -width XX
.It Fl -build-root Ar path
Specifies the build root in which to find the test programs referenced by
the Kyuafile, if different from the Kyuafile's directory.
See
.Sx Build directories
below for more information.
.It Fl -kyuafile Ar path , Fl k Ar path
Specifies the Kyuafile to process.
Defaults to a
.Pa Kyuafile
file in the current directory.
.It Fl -results-file Ar path , Fl s Ar path

Specifies the results file to create.
Defaults to
.Sq LATEST ,
which causes
.Nm
to automatically generate a new results file for the test run.
.Pp
The following values are accepted:
.Bl -tag -width XX
.It Sq NEW
Requests the automatic generation of a new results filename based on the test
suite being run and the current time.
.It Explicit filename (aka everything else)
Store the results file where indicated.

.Em Build directories
(or object directories, target directories, product directories, etc.) is
the concept that allows a developer to keep the source tree clean from
build products by asking the build system to place such build products
under a separate subtree.
.Pp
Most build systems today support build directories.
For example, the GNU Automake/Autoconf build system exposes such concept when
invoked as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ cd my-project-1.0
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ../configure
$ make
.Ed
.Pp
Under such invocation, all the results of the build are left in the
.Pa my-project-1.0/build/
subdirectory while maintaining the contents of
.Pa my-project-1.0/
intact.
.Pp
Because build directories are an integral part of most build systems, and
because they are a tool that developers use frequently,
.Nm
supports build directories too.
This manifests in the form of
.Nm
being able to run tests from build directories while reading the (often
immutable) test suite definition from the source tree.
.Pp
One important property of build directories is that they follow (or need to
follow) the exact same layout as the source tree.
For example, consider the following directory listings:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
src/Kyuafile
src/bin/ls/
src/bin/ls/Kyuafile
src/bin/ls/ls.c
src/bin/ls/ls_test.c
src/sbin/su/
src/sbin/su/Kyuafile
src/sbin/su/su.c
src/sbin/su/su_test.c

obj/bin/ls/
obj/bin/ls/ls*
obj/bin/ls/ls_test*
obj/sbin/su/
obj/sbin/su/su*
obj/sbin/su/su_test*
.Ed
.Pp
Note how the directory layout within
.Pa src/
matches that of
.Pa obj/ .
The
.Pa src/
directory contains only source files and the definition of the test suite
(the Kyuafiles), while the
.Pa obj/
directory contains only the binaries generated during a build.
.Pp
All commands that deal with the workspace support the
.Fl -build-root Ar path
option.
When this option is provided, the directory specified by the
option is considered to be the root of the build directory.
For example, considering our previous fake tree layout, we could invoke
.Nm
as any of the following:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ kyua test --kyuafile=src/Kyuafile --build-root=obj
$ cd src && kyua test --build-root=../obj

Results files contain, as their name implies, the results of the execution of a
test suite.
Each test suite executed by
.Xr kyua-test 1
generates a new results file, and such results files can be loaded later on by
inspection commands such as
.Xr kyua-report 1
to analyze their contents.
.Pp
Results files support identifier-based lookups and also path name lookups.
The differences between the two are described below.
.Pp
The default naming scheme for the results files provides simple support for
identifier-based lookups and historical recording of test suite runs.
Each results file is given an identifier derived from the test suite that
generated it and the time the test suite was run.
Kyua can later look up results files by these fields.
.Pp
The identifier follows this pattern:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
\*(Lttest_suite\*(Gt.\*(LtYYYYMMDD\*(Gt-\*(LtHHMMSS\*(Gt-\*(Ltuuuuuu\*(Gt
.Ed
.Pp
where
.Sq test_suite
is the path to the root of the test suite that was run with all slashes replaced
by underscores and
.Sq YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-uuuuuu
is a timestamp with microsecond resolution.
.Pp
When using the default naming scheme, results files are stored in the
.Pa ~/.kyua/store/
subdirectory and each file holds a name of the form:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
~/.kyua/store/results.\*(Ltidentifier\*(Gt.db
.Ed
.Pp
Results files are simple SQLite databases with the schema described in the
.Pa /usr/share/kyua/store/schema_v?.sql
files.
For details on the schema, please refer to the heavily commented SQL file.

A
.Em test filter
is a string that is used to match test cases or test programs in a test suite.
Filters have the following form:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
test_program_name[:test_case_name]
.Ed
.Pp
Where
.Sq test_program_name
is the name of a test program or a subdirectory in the test suite, and
.Sq test_case_name
is the name of a test case.

The test programs and test cases run by
.Nm
are all executed in a deterministic environment.
This known, clean environment serves to make the test execution as
reproducible as possible and also to prevent clashes between tests that may,
for example, create auxiliary files with overlapping names.
.Pp
For plain test programs and for TAP test programs, the whole test program
is run under a single instance of the environment described in this page.
For ATF test programs (see
.Xr atf 7 ) ,
each individual test case
.Em and
test cleanup routine are executed in separate environments.
.Bl -tag -width XX
.It Process space
Each test is executed in an independent processes.
Corollary: the test can do whatever it wants to the current process (such
as modify global variables) without having to undo such changes.
.It Session and process group
The test is executed in its own session and its own process group.
There is no controlling terminal attached to the session.
.Pp
Should the test spawn any children, the children should maintain the same
session and process group.
Modifying any of these settings prevents
.Nm
from being able to kill any stray subprocess as part of the cleanup phase.
If modifying these settings is necessary, or if any subprocess started by
the test decides to use a different process group or session, it is the
responsibility of the test to ensure those subprocesses are forcibly
terminated during cleanup.
.It Work directory
The test is executed in a temporary directory automatically created by the
runtime engine.
Corollary: the test can write to its current directory
without needing to clean any files and/or directories it creates.
The runtime engine takes care to recursively delete the temporary directories
after the execution of a test case.
Any file systems mounted within the temporary directory are also unmounted.
.It Home directory
The
.Va HOME
environment variable is set to the absolute path of the work directory.
.It Umask
The value of the umask is set to 0022.
.It Environment
The
.Va LANG ,
.Va LC_ALL ,
.Va LC_COLLATE ,
.Va LC_CTYPE ,
.Va LC_MESSAGES ,
.Va LC_MONETARY ,
.Va LC_NUMERIC
and
.Va LC_TIME
variables are unset.
.Pp
The
.Va TZ
variable is set to
.Sq UTC .
.Pp
The
.Va TMPDIR
variable is set to the absolute path of the work directory.
This is to prevent the test from mistakenly using a temporary directory
outside of the automatically-managed work directory, should the test use the
.Xr mktemp 3
familiy of functions.
.It Process limits
The maximum soft core size limit is raised to its corresponding hard limit.
This is a simple, best-effort attempt at allowing tests to dump core for
further diagnostic purposes.
.It Configuration varibles
The test engine may pass run-time configuration variables to the test program
via the environment.
The name of the configuration variable is prefixed with
.Sq TEST_ENV_
so that a configuration variable of the form
.Sq foo=bar
becomes accessible in the environment as
.Sq TEST_ENV_foo=bar .
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
command returns 0 if all executed test cases pass or 1 if any of the
executed test cases fails or if any of the given test case filters does not
match any test case.
.Pp
Additional exit codes may be returned as described in
.Xr kyua 1 .
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Ss Workflow with results files
If one runs the following command twice in a row:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
kyua test -k /usr/tests/Kyuafile
.Ed
.Pp
the two executions will generate two different files with names like:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
~/.kyua/store/results.usr_tests.20140731-150500-196784.db
~/.kyua/store/results.usr_tests.20140731-151730-997451.db
.Ed
.Pp
Taking advantage of the default naming scheme, the following commands would all
generate a report for the results of the
.Em latest
execution of the test suite:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd /usr/tests && kyua report
cd /usr/tests && kyua report --results-file=LATEST
kyua report --results-file=/usr/tests
kyua report --results-file=usr_tests
kyua report --results-file=usr_tests.20140731-151730-997451
.Ed
.Pp
But it is also possible to explicitly load data for older runs or from
explicitly-named files:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
kyua report \\
    --results-file=usr_tests.20140731-150500-196784
kyua report \\
    --results-file=~/.kyua/store/results.usr_tests.20140731-150500-196784.db
