.Dt KYUA-LIST 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm "kyua list"
.Nd Lists test cases and their metadata
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl -build-root Ar path
.Op Fl -kyuafile Ar file
.Op Fl -verbose
.Ar test_case1 Op Ar .. test_caseN
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command scans all the test programs and test cases in a test suite (as
defined by a
.Xr kyuafile 5 )
and prints a list of all their names, optionally accompanied by any metadata
properties they have.
.Pp
The optional arguments to
.Nm
are used to select which test programs or test cases to run.
These are filters and are described below in
.Sx Test filters .
.Pp
This command must be run within a test suite or a test suite must be
provided with the
.Fl -kyuafile
flag.
.Pp
The following subcommand options are recognized:
.Bl -tag -width XX
.It Fl -build-root Ar path
Specifies the build root in which to find the test programs referenced
by the Kyuafile, if different from the Kyuafile's directory.
See
.Sx Build directories
below for more information.
.It Fl -kyuafile Ar path , Fl k Ar path
Specifies the Kyuafile to process.
Defaults to a
.Pa Kyuafile
file in the current directory.
.It Fl -verbose , Fl v
Prints metadata properties for every test case.

.Em Build directories
(or object directories, target directories, product directories, etc.) is
the concept that allows a developer to keep the source tree clean from
build products by asking the build system to place such build products
under a separate subtree.
.Pp
Most build systems today support build directories.
For example, the GNU Automake/Autoconf build system exposes such concept when
invoked as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ cd my-project-1.0
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ../configure
$ make
.Ed
.Pp
Under such invocation, all the results of the build are left in the
.Pa my-project-1.0/build/
subdirectory while maintaining the contents of
.Pa my-project-1.0/
intact.
.Pp
Because build directories are an integral part of most build systems, and
because they are a tool that developers use frequently,
.Nm
supports build directories too.
This manifests in the form of
.Nm
being able to run tests from build directories while reading the (often
immutable) test suite definition from the source tree.
.Pp
One important property of build directories is that they follow (or need to
follow) the exact same layout as the source tree.
For example, consider the following directory listings:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
src/Kyuafile
src/bin/ls/
src/bin/ls/Kyuafile
src/bin/ls/ls.c
src/bin/ls/ls_test.c
src/sbin/su/
src/sbin/su/Kyuafile
src/sbin/su/su.c
src/sbin/su/su_test.c

obj/bin/ls/
obj/bin/ls/ls*
obj/bin/ls/ls_test*
obj/sbin/su/
obj/sbin/su/su*
obj/sbin/su/su_test*
.Ed
.Pp
Note how the directory layout within
.Pa src/
matches that of
.Pa obj/ .
The
.Pa src/
directory contains only source files and the definition of the test suite
(the Kyuafiles), while the
.Pa obj/
directory contains only the binaries generated during a build.
.Pp
All commands that deal with the workspace support the
.Fl -build-root Ar path
option.
When this option is provided, the directory specified by the
option is considered to be the root of the build directory.
For example, considering our previous fake tree layout, we could invoke
.Nm
as any of the following:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ kyua list --kyuafile=src/Kyuafile --build-root=obj
$ cd src && kyua list --build-root=../obj

A
.Em test filter
is a string that is used to match test cases or test programs in a test suite.
Filters have the following form:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
test_program_name[:test_case_name]
.Ed
.Pp
Where
.Sq test_program_name
is the name of a test program or a subdirectory in the test suite, and
.Sq test_case_name
is the name of a test case.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
command returns 0 on success or 1 if any of the given test case filters
does not match any test case.
.Pp
Additional exit codes may be returned as described in
.Xr kyua 1 .
