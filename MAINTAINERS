Please note that the content of this file is strictly advisory.
No locks listed here are valid.  The only strict review requirements
are granted by core.  These are documented in head/LOCKS and enforced
by svnadmin/conf/approvers.

The source tree is a community effort.  However, some folks go to the
trouble of looking after particular areas of the tree.  In return for
their active caretaking of the code it is polite to coordinate changes
with them.  This is a list of people who have expressed an interest in
part of the code or listed their active caretaking role so that other
committers can easily find somebody who is familiar with it.  The notes
should specify if there is a 3rd party source tree involved or other
things that should be kept in mind.

However, this is not a 'big stick', it is an offer to help and a source
of guidance.  It does not override the communal nature of the tree.
It is not a registry of 'turf' or private property.

***
This list is prone to becoming stale quickly.  The best way to find the recent
maintainer of a sub-system is to check recent logs for that directory or
sub-system.
