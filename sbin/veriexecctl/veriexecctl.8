.Dt VERIEXECCTL 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm veriexecctl
.Nd load verified exec fingerprints
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar fingerprints
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command loads an in-kernel metadata store of the fingerprints
given in the
.Ar fingerprints
file.
The kernel can then calculate the fingerprint of programs at time of
execution or files that are opened with
.Dv O_VERIFY
and verify whether the fingerprints match.
.Pp
The
.Ar fingerprints
file contains lines of fields separated by one or more whitespace
characters:
.Pp
.Dl path	type	fingerprint	options
.Bl -tag -width fingerprint
.It Em path
Full path to the file.
.It Em type
Type of fingerprint used.
Currently this may be any of rmd160, sha1, sha256, sha384, or sha512.
Availability of these fingerprint types is dependent on kernel support.
The
.Va security.mac.veriexec.algorithms
sysctl is consulted to determine the list of valid fingerprint types.
.It Em fingerprint
A hexadecimal representation of the fingerprint for the file.
.It Em options
Associated options for the file.
Currently there are four valid options:
.Bl -tag -width INDIRECT
.It Pa INDIRECT
If this option is set then the executable cannot be invoked directly, it
can only be used as an interpreter in shell scripts.
.It Pa FILE
Indicates that the fingerprint is associated with a file, not an
executable.
Files have their fingerprints verified during
.Xr open 2
and are automatically made read only.
This option may be used to verify shared libraries have not been
tampered with.
.It Pa NO_PTRACE
If this option is set then the executable cannot be traced with the
.Xr ptrace 2 process tracing and debugging call.
.It Pa TRUSTED
If this option is set then the executable is allowed to write to the
.Xr mem 4
devices.
By default, when verified execution is enforced, no process
is allowed to write to the
.Xr mem 4
devices.
.El
.El
.Pp
There must be only one executable/fingerprint pair per line.
Comments are indicated by the first character of a line being a
.Sq \&#
character.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/veriexec -compact
.It Pa /dev/veriexec
verified executable device node
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr sysctl 3
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
first appeared in
.Nx 2.0 .
.Sh NOTES
.Nm
requires the kernel to have been configured with the
.Dv MAC_VERIEXEC
option and the veriexec pseudo-device.
