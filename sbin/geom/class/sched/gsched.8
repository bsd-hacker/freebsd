The
.Nm
utility changes the scheduling policy of the requests going to its providers.
By now it just uses a C-LOOK policy with a little anticipation.
.Pp
The first argument to
.Nm
indicates an action to be performed:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm configure"
.It Cm create
Set up a scheduling provider on the given devices.
If the operation succeeds, the new provider should appear with name
.Pa /dev/ Ns Ao Ar dev Ac Ns Pa .sched .
The kernel module
.Pa geom_sched.ko
will be loaded if it is not loaded already.
.It Cm configure
Configure existing scheduling provider.
At the moment it is not used at all.
.It Cm destroy
Turn off the given scheduling providers.
.It Cm reset
Do nothing.
.It Cm list
See
.Xr geom 8 .
.It Cm status

The following
.Xr sysctl 8
variables can be used to control the behavior of the

.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va kern.geom.sched.debug : No 0
Debug level of the
.Nm NOP
GEOM class.
This can be set to a number between 0 and 2 inclusive.
If set to 0 minimal debug information is printed, and if set to 2 the
maximum amount of debug information is printed.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
Exit status is 0 on success, and 1 if the command fails.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example shows how to create a scheduling provider for disk
.Pa /dev/da0
, and how to destroy it.
