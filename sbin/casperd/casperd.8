.Sh NAME
.Nm casperd
.Nd "Capability Services friendly daemon"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl Fhv
.Op Fl l Ar listenqueue
.Op Fl D Ar servconfdir
.Op Fl P Ar pidfile
.Op Fl S Ar sockpath
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon hosts various services that can be accessed through
libcapsicum's capabilities by programs running in sandboxes.
For example it is prohibited to send UDP packets to arbitrary destinations
when operating in capability mode, which makes DNS resolution impossible.
To make it possible the
.Nm
daemon provides the
.Nm system.dns
service that proxies DNS resolution requests through a dedicated,
non-sandboxed process provided by
.Nm .
.Pp
The
.Nm
daemon can be started with the following command line arguments:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl D Ar servconfdir"
.It Fl D Ar servconfdir
Specify alternative location of the service configuration directory.
The default location is
.Pa /etc/casper/ .
.It Fl F
Start the
.Nm
daemon in the foreground.
By default
.Nm
starts in the background.
.It Fl h
Print the
.Nm
usage message.
.It Fl l Ar listenqueue
Specify depth of socket listen queue for the
.Nm
daemon.
The default queue length is
.Pa SOMAXCONN .
.It Fl P Ar pidfile

stored.
The default location is
.Pa /var/run/casperd.pid .
.It Fl S Ar sockpath
Specify alternative location of the

.Nm
daemon.
